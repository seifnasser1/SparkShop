            <h2>Padel Tennis</h2>
            <p> Is a variation of traditional tennis that is played with smaller
                racquets and a smaller court. The game is typically played with 
                two players or four players (two on each team) and the objective 
                is to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's court without
                them being able to return it. </p>

            <h2>Squash</h2>
            <p>Is a racket sport that is played by two or four players in an enclosed
                court. The game involves hitting a small rubber ball back and forth between
                the players, with the aim of making the ball bounce twice on the floor 
                before your opponent can return it. Points are scored when one player 
                fails to return the ball within the rules of the game. </p>

            <h2>CrossFit</h2>
            <p>CrossFit is a high-intensity fitness program that revolves around functional
                 movements, offering a dynamic and results-oriented approach to overall 
                 fitness. This training regimen encompasses a wide range of exercises, 
                 from weightlifting and cardio to bodyweight movements, all conducted with 
                 a strong emphasis on intensity. CrossFit fosters a sense of community and
                  camaraderie in its "boxes" (gyms), making it accessible to individuals of 
                  all fitness levels. Whether you're aiming to lose weight, build muscle, or 
                  enhance your endurance, CrossFit's scalable workouts and data-driven 
                  progress tracking can help you achieve your fitness goals while pushing 
                  your physical limits. </p>
